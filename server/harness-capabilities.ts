// What a bot gains or loses when its default engine (instanceId, hence
// driver) changes. Two per-driver facts decide it: whether the driver mounts
// the agents tool catalog at all (adapter capabilities.agentsMcp — a bot on
// a driver without it is never even told about the team tools), and which
// approval levels the destination driver implements. Turn-scoped catalog
// flags are identical on both sides of a switch, so the comparison below
// uses one envelope profile and lets the per-driver capability decide the
// delta; the tool names themselves come from the real catalog, so this
// never drifts from what a turn is actually shown.
